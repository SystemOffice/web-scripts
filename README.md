# VCCS System Office web-scripts Repository

The `web-scripts` repository is a public repository. This means that files within it can be delivered over the jsdelivr CDN, which is more reliable and fault-tolerant than VCCS servers, and comes with built-in minification. Typically, these files will be JavaScript and CSS, and are used to deliver customized functionality and enhancements through script inclusion. Specific deployments are in the [projects directory](projects/).

Code that will be delivered through `web-scripts` is developed, reviewed, and released through the separate [`web-scripts-dev`](https://github.com/SystemOffice/web-scripts-dev/) repository.
